# TemiApp
[Temi](https://www.robotemi.com/) is "a multinational robotics company that specializes in Robot as a Service solutions (RaaS), autonomous platforms, Al, smart assistant and cloud-based services", using their robots in many industries such as retail, healthcare, and hospitality.

Using Android, I created a centralized application for Temi robots to be used in the hospitality industry, specifically in long-term care homes. The application allows the Temi robots to be controlled remotely by the staff of the long-term care home, allowing them to run certain tasks with the temi, such as calling the residents to dinner. This streamlines many of the tasks that the staff would have to do, allowing them to focus on other more human-centric tasks.

This is an ongoing project. The current app allows several tasks to be run simultaneously, and for tasks to be logged in persistent storage. 

The goal is to have the app integrated with the [Temi SDK](https://github.com/robotemi/sdk) to have Temi-specific tasks such as navigation and speech recognition. We are attempting to get approval to use the SDK, which is currently protected by DRM.
